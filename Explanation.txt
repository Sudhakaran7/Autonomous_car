Albert is creating a autonomous car, where that car will move without human intervention,
that car will move in a sepcific sequence, Front and back,
When the car get 'Front', car does the following: 
position += move
move *= 2.
When the car get 'Back', car does the following: 
if your speed is positive then move = -1 , 
otherwise move = 1.(The car will be at same posisition)
For example,
after sequence "Front Front Back", the car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, 
and the moves goes to 1->2->4->-1.
Find the minimum lenght to reach the given target.

Sample Input:
3

Sample outpu:
2

Exaplanation:
after sequence "Front Front Back", the car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, 
and the moves goes to 1->2->4->-1.
so the moves are (1,3)
so the output is 2.

Sample input:
9

Sample output:
8
